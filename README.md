## Introduction
This project is a basic Java web application that I deploy on an AWS EC2 instance. The goal is to understand cloud-based development, deployments, and CI/CD pipelines using GitHub and AWS.

## Technologies
I used the following tools in this project:

- **Amazon EC2** – Hosting and deploying the Java web application  
- **GitHub** – Source code management  
- **VS Code Remote SSH** – Editing code directly on the EC2 server  
- **Java 17** – Application runtime  
- **Maven** – Build automation  
- **Apache Tomcat (optional if added later)** – For running the web app

## Setup

1. Install Java and Maven on EC2  
2. Generate a Maven webapp project:
